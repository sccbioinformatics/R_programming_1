# Standardising data

Lets stick with our expression data and cluster it. by doing this we'll learn more of the language, and some of the fundamental maths that runs underneath. Lets take a look at the range of the data, i.e getting the lowest and highest value in the matrix of variable genes we just made.
```{r}
range(hspc.var)
```


For some operations (such as making heatmaps) the data needs to be z-score normalised (scaled) first. When we scale data, each row of gene is standarised so that it's mean=0 and sd=1. Specifically for a gene `g` of the i-th row:

$$Z_i= \frac{g_i-\hat{g}}{\sigma_g}$$

Which means for every row $i$ we subtract from each element $g$ we subract the mean of the row $\hat{g}$ and then divide by the standard deviation of the row $\sigma_g$.

***Exercise:*** write a function called `zscore` which will take a single vector of values and scale them. When you have done this, `apply` this to the `hspc.var` matrix to scale all rows and call it `hspc.zs`.
```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}
zscore <- function(v){
  z <- (v-mean(v))/sd(v)
  z
}

hspc.zs <- apply(hspc.var,1,zscore)
```

Now take a look at the first row of the normalised data. Call `nrow` on the matrix. Does it look right? 

```{r}
hspc.zs <- t(apply(hspc.var,1,zscore))
boxplot(hspc.zs,las=2)
# compare to the original data
boxplot(hspc.var,las=2)
```


We can see now the data has been centralised around 0.

***Exercise:*** Do some Googling and see if there is a built in function in R that will zscore rows of data for you. Use it to zscore your data and save the output in `hspc.zs.v2`.

```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}

hspc.zs.v2 <- t(apply(hspc.var,1,scale))
hspc.zs.v2[1,]

```

Lets make sure the same thing has been returned by comparing the first row:

```{r}
all.equal(hspc.zs[10,],hspc.zs.v2[10,])
```
