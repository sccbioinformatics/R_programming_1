# Lists

So far we have talked about vectors and matrices. Often we want to collect these things and put them into one object under a single variable. For example:
```{r}
alpha <- LETTERS[1:8]
mat <- matrix(rnorm(40), nrow = 8)
listex1  <- list(char = alpha,nums = mat)
```

You can see that each item is given a name 'char' 'numb'  before it is put into the list. Each element can now be accessed via `$`:
```{r}
listex1$char
listex1$nums
listex1$nums[1,] # the matrix within the list is subsetted as before
```
Another way of doing the above is:
```{r}
listex1[[1]] # note the double square brackets
listex1[[2]]
listex1[[2]][1,]
```

Lists are ok, but they can become like the wild-west where things are thrown in with little organisation. They are fine for small things, but big data shouldn't be stored in them, or become the basis for a large project. You will see why later.
