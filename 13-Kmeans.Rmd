# Kmeans

We're going to program our first algorithm together! Kmeans ckustering is a common way to cluster expression data, and the algorithm is actually pretty simple, and a great start to learning programmatic thinking. The data we'll use comes from yeast where the expression of 256 genes have been measured as a synchronised population go through two divisions. It's a nice, small dataset with clear clusters.
