# Kmeans

We're going to program our first algorithm together! Kmeans clustering is a common way to cluster expression data, and the algorithm is actually pretty simple, and a great way to learn how to think programmatically. The data we'll use comes from yeast where the expression of 256 genes have been measured as a synchronised population go through two divisions. It's a nice, small dataset with clear clusters.

There is a file called "Spellman_Yeast_Cell_Cycle.tsv" (https://github.com/shambam/R_programming_1/blob/main/Spellman_Yeast_Cell_Cycle.tsv). Load it into a variable called `ycc` and convert it to a matrix.
```{r}
ycc <- read.delim("Spellman_Yeast_Cell_Cycle.tsv", row.names = 1, header = T, sep = "\t")
ycc <- as.matrix(ycc)
```

The data has already been z-scored, so we need to learn how to calculate the Euclidean distance between 2 genes ($g^{i}$ and $g^{j}$) (vector). We do this using the formula:

$$d_{ij}=\sqrt{\sum{(g^{i}_t-g^{j}_t)^2}}$$

Write a function called `e.dist` which takes two vectors `v1` and `v2` and calculates the distance between them. In our data, these two vectors (`v1` and `v2`) are the different expression values of two genes through the different time points measured in the yeast cell cycle .
```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}
e.dist <- function(v1, v2){
  d <- sqrt(sum((v1-v2)^2))
  d
}
```

The kmeans algorithm needs the user to say how many clusters are being searched for, so in this case we'll say **8**.

1. Define 8 centroids randomly, i.e. pick 8 genes at random.
2. Calculate the distance between each gene to each of the 8 centroids.
3. Assign each gene to its closest centroid.
4. For each of the 8 clusters, calculate a new centroid.
5. Repeat 100 times steps 2, 3, and 4.

We'll now work through this problem together and crowd source a solution.
```{r}
centroids <- ycc[sample(1:256, 8, replace=F),] # make a vector of random clusters. We are sampling 8 numbers (since we want 8 centroids) out of the vector 1:256 which represents the genes in ycc. Check that we indeed have 256 genes in ycc!

dists <- matrix(0, nrow = 256, ncol = 8) # make an empty matrix to fill with distances.

clusters <- NULL # make an empty variable to catch the clusters in the loop below
for(iteration in 1:100){ # 100 iterations

  for(gene in 1:256){
  
    for(k in 1:8){
      dists[gene, k] <- e.dist(ycc[gene,], centroids[k,]) # for each gene calculate the distance to each centroid (k).
    }
  }

  clusters <- apply(dists, 1, which.min) # assign a  cluster according to which centroid is nearest

  for(k in 1:8){
    centroids[k,] <- apply(ycc[which(clusters == k),], 2, mean) # define new centroids.
  }
}

```

***Exercise*** Plot your clusters using base R or ggplots. Dealers choice.

ggplots:
```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
ycc.cl <- cbind(as.factor(clusters), ycc)

colnames(ycc.cl)[1] <- c("Cluster")

ycc.df <- data.frame(ID = rownames(ycc.cl), ycc.cl, row.names = NULL)

ytm <- melt(ycc.df, c("ID", "Cluster"))

ggplot(ytm, aes(x = variable, y = value, group = ID)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~Cluster, ncol = 3)

```

base R:

```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}
par(mfrow=c(2, 4))

for(k in 1:8){
  
  ycc.c <- ycc[which(clusters == k),]
  plot(ycc.c[1,],ty="l",ylim = range(ycc.c))
  apply(ycc.c, 1, lines)
  
}


```

***Improvements***

1. The code above will do 100 iterations, but what if the algorithm converges after 20? Alter the code so it stops when no further changes are made and help save the planet.
2. We have a bunch of "magic numbers". Magic numbers are hard-coded numbers that might raise questions to our code readers (e.g. "where did these came from?", "why 256 and not 255?", "what is this 8?"). Improve this by writing a function that will take *any* `data`, *any* number of clusters `K`, and user-defined number of `iterations` as arguments. Return a list containing the cluster assignments and data using Kmeans clustering. 
3. Write a function that will plot from the list, a cluster of the user's choice.

Don't forget to document your functions nicely so that there is no room for confusions.
