Welcome! 

This is the material for R Programming I which was written in **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

When you render an HTML from this material in RStudio, you'll need to manually copy _main.html to docs/index.html otherwise the code unrolling (show/hide code) will not work.
