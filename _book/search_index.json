Importantly, we want to get you thinking like a programmer. This doesn’t mean that by the end of the course you will know R fully, but you will know enough so you can go online and look for the help you need to complete most tasks. 1.1 Practice makes perfect Programming is like any skill, the more you practice the better you get. It’s really important that you keep using what you have learned after the course is completed otherwise there is a good chance you will forget everything and you’ll be back to square one. 1.2 Why Use R? R is a programming language with a focus on mathematics and statistics, but R can be used for a wide variety of applications given the flexibility of the language. R is also free, and available for all operating systems. Given the richness of the language and no cost to use it, bioinformaticians have used R for more than 20 years as the platform for which which to develop packages to solve bioinformatics problems. The BioConductor Project is a repository for bioinformatics tools which continues to grow, and hosts packages such as DESeq2 which you may have heard of. Some other popular packages such as Seurat aren’t actually hosted by Bioconductor, but in the main R package repository. We’ll cover package installation later later. 1.3 What other languages do bioinformaticians use? The Python language has been rocketing in popularity for the past few years, particularly among data scientists whi make use of the AI/ML tools such as Tensorflow and PyTorch. Scanpy is a very popular package for single-cell analysis. For very computationally intensive tasks (e.g sequence alignment), languages such as C/C++/Rust are more commonly used, but these are far more difficult to learn. 1.4 Getting R and Rstudio Point your browser to http://cran.r-project.org/ to download and install the latest version of R. For these tutorials we are also going to use RStudio which is an advanced development environment for R which includes a window for an editor, console, and plotting window. You will see what this means later.

There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. "],["cross.html", " 3 Cross-references 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " 3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
