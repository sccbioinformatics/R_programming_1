# Reading and writing files.

You have to get the data into R first before you can analyse it (this helps a lot). R has many useful functions to do this, so now we can take our first look at some expression data. Download this file (http://bone.bmc.lu.se/Public/Mouse_HSPC_reduced.txt) and save it to your current working directory.

***Exercise:*** Open the file in Excel or something to see how it looks, and then call `help(read.delim)` in your console. Try to work out how the file you are looking at could be read into R using this function.

This is how I would do it:
```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}
hspc.data <- read.delim("Mouse_HSPC_reduced.txt", header = T, row.name = 1, sep = "\t")
```

We can now look at a few aspects of the data:
```{r}
colnames(hspc.data) # view the column names
nrow(hspc.data) # the number of rows in the dataset
ncol(hspc.data) # number of columns
dim(hspc.data) # number of rows and columns together
colnames(hspc.data) #output the columns headers
```

***Exercise:*** Using subsetting we learnt about earlier, split this data matrix into three parts called `lthsc`, `mep` and `gmp` to separate the cell types shown in the headings. For this look at the help page for a function called `grep`.

```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide',results=F}
lthsc <- hspc.data[, grep("LTHSC", colnames(hspc.data))]
mep <- hspc.data[, grep("MEP", colnames(hspc.data))]
gmp <- hspc.data[, grep("GMP", colnames(hspc.data))]
```

To write a table use the `write.table` function:
```{r}
write.table(lthsc, "LTHSC_data.txt", row.names = T, col.names = NA, sep = "\t", quote = F)
```

***Exercise:*** Write out the data for the MEP and GMP data into two files.

The data tables we have now are in the form of a data.frame. Try:
```{r}
class(mep)
```

This can be an awkward format for some operations so we can convert it to a simple matrix first:
```{r}
hspc.data <- as.matrix(hspc.data)
lthsc <- as.matrix(lthsc)
mep <- as.matrix(mep)
gmp <- as.matrix(mep)
```

Try this now:
```{r}
class(mep)
```
