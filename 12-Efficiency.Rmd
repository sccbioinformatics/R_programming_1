# Efficiency- time is precious.

Something to remember- always- is that comuputer resources such as RAM and disk space should be used wisely. In this was your code will be faster and leaner. Here is a small example where we make a vector from one to 50,000 using a loop:

```{r}
values <- NULL # make an empty container to catch the values

for(i in 1:50000){
  values <- c(values,i)
}

values[1:10]
```

Lets do this again, but this time measure how long it takes using the `system.time` function:

```{r}
values <- NULL # make an empty container to catch the values
system.time(for(i in 1:50000){  values <- c(values,i)})
length(values) # check length
```

Ok, now the same thing again, but this time we will fill a vector rather that growing it:

```{r}
values <- vector("numeric",100000) # make an empty container to catch the values
system.time(for(i in 1:100000){  values[i] <- i})
length(values) #check length
```
**Why, do you think, this was so much faster?**
